Just some  code which I write for fun and to keep my skills sharp.
______________________________________
- Boo directory is for bad code that i want to be preserved forever to mock my past self.
- Personal_Libs is for functions and classses that were so good, they needed to be converted into libraries.
_______________________________________
- MenuV2 is a previous directory of a MenuV8 project.
- .config is for dotfiles(obiviously).
