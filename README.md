# Tree of this repo looks something like this:
- Boo directory is for bad code that i want to be preserved forever to mock my past self.
- Personal_Libs is for functions and classses that were so good, they needed to be converted into libraries.
- Mini_Projects is for small,quick projects, which didn't need a separate repo.
- .config is for dotfiles(obiviously).
