2. Creates and writes a file
3. Moves the file to a folder and zips the folder
4. Moves the zip folder into an another folder
5. Repeat until all of our folders are inside one
6. Move the final folder and zip it with the highest level of compression
7. Check if the zip file exists, clean up the workspace.
8. Done, zip file created!
